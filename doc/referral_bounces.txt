Scenario:
There is a Rails application called Blueskly
A potential lead clicks on an ad link on a separate website.
The ad link includes the following parameters: propertycode, campaignid, trackingid, and api_token.
The link leads to a Rails controller action which:
 - Intializes an empty bounce_data hash
 - Initializes and Defaults a website_url variable to 'https://www.bluestoneproperties.us/'
 - Finds an active and incoming LeadSource matching the "slug" with text 'adbounce', and a matching api_token.
   - If it is not found throw an error with the message: 'ReferralBounce ERROR: LeadSource for token "#{ api_token }" not found!'
 - Finds an active Property: the Property model has a "code" attribute which matches the propertycode parameter
   - If it is not found throw an error with the message: 'ReferralBounce ERROR: Property with code "#{ propertycode }" not found!'
   - Assigns the Property "website" value to website_url
 - Detects the http referer of the request
 - Creates a hash of attributes for creating a ReferralBounce called bounce_data
 - Creates a ReferralBounce model instance with this data and saves it
 - Redirects the lead to the property website URL
 - Wrap all of the action code in a block to capture any errors:
   - The exception is logged using ErrorNotification.send(error, bounce_data)
   - The action completes the redirect regardless of any errors

The ReferralBounce model has the following attributes: property_id, propertycode, campaignid, trackingid, referer. It references the Property model.
The Property model already exists, and has the following attributes: id, code, website, active
ReferralBounces belong to Properties and vice versa.
When a Property is deleted, delete all associated ReferralBounces.
There is a GET route entry for the controller action.
The rails controller route is namespaced with 'api/v1'.
The controller is named ReferralBounce.
The controller definition uses module syntax for namespacing.
The action is named 'refer'.

Instructions:
Use a rails command to generate the ReferralBounce model and controller, with no tests or helpers created for either.
Display all relevant code.
